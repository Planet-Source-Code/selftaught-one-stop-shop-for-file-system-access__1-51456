## One\-Stop shop for File System Access


</div>

### Description

This code replaces all features of the the FileSystemObject through the API for very fast access. Also provides fast API File I/O, file searching, _ALL_ special folders without slow late bound objects or unnecessary dependencies, and much, much more. All code here was written by me, and free for you to use in any way you find beneficial. As always, I ask only for bug reports and ideas on improvement.
